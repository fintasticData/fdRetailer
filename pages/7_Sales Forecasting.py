st.write("""
By implementing advanced sales forecasting models, your business can achieve the following benefits:
- **Improved Accuracy**: Reduce errors in sales predictions and make more informed decisions.
- **Optimized Inventory Management**: Ensure optimal stock levels and reduce the risk of stockouts or overstocking.
- **Enhanced Planning**: Better anticipate demand fluctuations and plan marketing, procurement, and staffing accordingly.
- **Increased Revenue**: Maximize sales opportunities by understanding future demand trends.

# Steps Involved Section
st.header("Steps Involved")
st.write("""
To implement a robust sales forecasting improvement project, the following steps are typically involved:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather historical sales data and relevant external factors such as market trends, economic indicators, and seasonal patterns.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure it is suitable for analysis. This includes handling missing values, outliers, and data normalization.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Identify and create relevant features that will be used in the forecasting model.
4. **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate machine learning models for forecasting, such as ARIMA, LSTM, or Prophet.
5. **Model Training**: Train the selected models using the historical data and validate their performance.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the models using performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and others.
7. **Deployment**: Deploy the best-performing model to a production environment for real-time forecasting.
8. **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Continuously monitor the model's performance and retrain it as needed to adapt to changing conditions.

Each of these steps requires careful planning and execution to ensure the success of the sales forecasting improvement project.
